quine
==============

A quine is a program that prints out its own source code (without using file I/O).

It's a fun little program that utilises the ASCII code of `34` for `"` to get the double quote within the string and gets the tabbed indents by having the first element of the code array simply be the tab.

There is indubitably a shorter way of writing a quine, but this is a simple, fun and easy to understand one.
