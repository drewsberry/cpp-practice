cpp-practice
============

Practice programs to stop my CPP getting rusty. Not for any particular use by anyone.

The best way to keep something fresh in your mind, and stop myself from losing familiarity with C++, these are a personal collection of simple programs written for my practice.

Feel free to use this code according to the liberal MIT licence and as ideas for your own practice problems.
