============

Practice programs to stop my C++ getting rusty. Not for any particular use by anyone.

The best way to keep something fresh in your mind, and stop myself from losing familiarity with C++, these are a personal collection of simple programs written for my practice.

Feel free to use this code according to the liberal MIT licence and as ideas for your own practice problems. It doesn't have too much at the moment, but I'll gradually fill it up with more and more sample programs.

To add a new project, just run `./newproject projname` and the script will automatically create a directory for it, containing `.gitignore`, `Makefile` and empty source file.
